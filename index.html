    <div class="about"><h1>HAVE YOU KNOWN THAT...</h1><H2>Ancient Egyptians loved board games</H2>After a long day’s work along the Nile River,
         Egyptians often relaxed by playing board games.
          Several different games were played, 
          including “Mehen” and “Dogs and Jackals,”
           but perhaps the most popular was a game of chance known
            as “Senet.” This pastime dates back as far as 3500 B.C.
             and was played on a long board painted with 30 squares.
              Each player had a set of pieces that were moved along
               the board according to rolls of dice or the throwing sticks. 
               Historians still debate Senet’s exact rules, but there is little
                doubt of the game’s popularity. Paintings depict Queen Nefertari 
                playing Senet, and pharaohs like Tutankhamen even had game boards
                 buried with them in their tombs.</div>
